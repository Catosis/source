45% of the world does not have access to the internet. Loon aims to change that. We provide internet via huge high-altitude balloons that transmit wifi signals from serviced regions, between balloons, and back to users on the ground. They have no motors onboard the balloons, instead using the stratification of winds in the eponymous stratosphere to navgiate the world.

I am currently working as a Flight Engineer. My role is half mission control and half software programming. The mission control portion involves coordinating with Air Traffic Control centers around the world, monitoring an active fleet of balloons using hundreds of real-time telemetry points, and making decisions while balancing the implications of flying balloons in international airspaces and Loon’s company goals. The software aspect uses a variety of languages from SQL to C++ to develop tools that Flight Engineers and other groups within Loon use. We help develop some simulation tools, UI’s, and our own automation systems that monitor the health of our fleet.
