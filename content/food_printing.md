Food Printing is set to revolutionize how we think about food. Rather than using metals and plastics to lay down layers, 3D Food Printing uses edible food-based pastes that can be layed down in infinite numbers of patterns, textures, and flavors. The implication of this goes well beyond just simple snacks. It allows chefs to create delicacies that are impossible to do by hand, but also has the potential to reach consumer homes. People crave complete, fast nutrition as evidenced by the success of Soylent and nutrition bars, and 3DFP offers that in the form of completely customizable food.

Conceptualized by Professor Hod Lipson, our machine has the ability to cook food directly on the machine, unilke any other food printer that exists. Current 3D food printers that produce meals that require cooking use traditional convective or conductive methods to process food after the printing process, which limits their ability to combine multiple materials in a single food object. Integrating an infrared lamp heating mechanism into the printer allows for more precise spatial control of the heat being delivered to printed food, the ability to create complex food patterns with more ingredient complexity, and the integration of multiple food ingredients in a single 3D object. his novel approach to onboard cooking allows users to combine different ingredients—such as chicken with dough—and cook each ingredient selectively. The results are summarized in our paper Multi-material Three-Dimensional Food Printing with Simultaneous Infrared Cooking available to read <a href = "http://doi.org/10.1089/3dp.2018.0042">here</a>.

My role as lead of this project from September 2017 - Jan 2018 was completeing the data collection needed for the paper, and developing the materials needed to create our successful multi-material print. From Janurary 2018 onward, my team of eight worked on the expanding the capabilities of the food printer that have never been tried before. My team tested frying, broiling, oil dispensing, and powder (for seasoning) dispensing all done autonomously by the machine. None of these methods have been published or tested before our work. During this semester, we successfully demonstrated frying of tortillas using by dispensing oil using a piezoelectric diffuser and using our exsisting infrared-spotlight printer in the same print. Research into this area is still ongoing.
